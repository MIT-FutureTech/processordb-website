He created the Wireless Identification and Sensing Platform (WISP), an open source platform for research on RF-powered sensing systems.  He has also introduced new low power communication techniques, including Ambient Backscatter and communication via Modulated Johnson Noise. Ambient Backscatter systems are often powered by ambient RF signals, and communicate by reflecting those same pre-existing RF signals. His work on WISP and energy harvesting systems led him to begin looking at the historical scaling of the energy efficiency of digital electronics, in order to explain the progress to date on battery-free, energy harvesting systems, as well as make predictions about their future.
